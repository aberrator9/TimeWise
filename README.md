# TimeWise

A scheduled task app, designed for repeated learning-related tasks and subtasks, with the goal of eliminating decision fatigue. Think of it as an aspirational mix of a calendar, a Todo list, and a Pomodoro app.

Each item you add represents a category of activity that you plan to do on a specific day and time.

Let's look at an example...

## Edit Mode

We'll start by adding a task, "Try a new recipe ðŸ¥§," and scheduling it for Fridays at 5:00pm. Our task needs to have at least one time range in order to become active.

Then we'll add a few subtasks.

## Focus Mode

In Focus Mode, we'll see the time remaining while our task is active, or the next task when no task is active.

By default, TimeWise will show only the next subtask beneath our task's name. This is done to help alleviate decision fatigue. However, if you don't feel like doing that particular task first, you can always click the randomize button ðŸŽ².

## Potential uses for this app
