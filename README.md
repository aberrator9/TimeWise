# TimeWise

A scheduled task app, designed for repeated learning-related tasks and subtasks, with the goal of eliminating decision fatigue. Think of it as an aspirational mix of a calendar, a Todo list, and a Pomodoro app.

Let's explain with an example...

## Edit Mode

We'll start by adding a task, "Try a new recipe! ðŸ¥§," and schedule it for Fridays at 5:00pm. Our task needs to have at least one time range in order to become active. 

Then we'll add a few subtasks.

## Focus Mode

In Focus Mode, we'll see the time remaining while our task is active, or the next task when no task is active.

By default, TimeWise will show only the next subtask beneath our task's name. This is done to eliminate decision fatigue, but if you don't feel like doing that particular task first, you can always click the randomize button ðŸŽ².

### Other uses for this app

- Try a new recipe every Friday at 5:00pm.
- Watch an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space 9 at noon on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- Use Saturday morning to practice woodworking. Subtasks: Dove tail joint, table legs, veneering.
